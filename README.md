# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is project0 for HarvardX's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, by student jaimeglz (jaimeglz1952@hotmail.com). I have chosen an “electronic zoo” as the topic for my web site, and by “electronic zoo” I mean a collection of animal pictures and photographs. As of today, the collection is very small, and the information provided is very limited. There is also a final page with “future activities”, which is provided mainly to fulfill some of the requirements of the exercise.

The main reason for choosing the “electronic zoo” is that – in addition to other topics – I have been teaching object-oriented analysis and design with a medium-sized company. Modeling a game called “electronic zoo”, intended mainly for children, is one the first exercises in our course, because it lends itself so well  to explain concepts like classes, objects, generalization, inheritance, attributes... and so forth. Hopefully, in the not so distant future I will be able to develop a zoo populated with interactive virtual animals, and not just with pictures.

I hope the navigation section in upper-left side of each page is sufficiently intuitive: just click on the hyperlink, and the requested page section – or the web page you want to visit – will be displayed. On pages two to five (elephants, quokka, tigress...), you will find a hyperlink to “General information”, where you will find the table that is requested as part of the exercise.

The stylesheet files (SCSS,and CSS) are in project0's main directory, together the HTML pages. I hope to have exceeded the minimum number of required artifacts listed in the bulleted items of the exercise requirements.
 
Finally, please be patient with me. For at least the next four weeks I have a heavy work-load, so I will be advancing slowly towards course completion.
